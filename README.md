# dashdodge
very bad game that makes you angry
and a small canvas game i made in one html file.

## play
open the github pages link, or download the repo and open `index.html`.

controls
- arrows or wasd to move
- space to dash
- r to restart
- esc to open the skin menu

## skins
you can change:
- player color
- player shape (circle, square, triangle)

## notes
- works best on desktop
- if it feels too fast or too slow, change `accel`, `maxSpd`, and `friction` inside the script

## why i made it
bored
